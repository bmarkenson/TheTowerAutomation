# pack.sh â€” create a zip of the current directory with sane excludes + placeholder dirs
# Usage:
#   ./pack.sh                # creates ./TheTower.zip from .
#   ./pack.sh /path/out.zip  # custom output path
#
# Behavior:
# - Excludes .venv, .git, __pycache__, screenshots/matches, logs contents, old/new (entirely)
# - Includes an empty 'logs/' directory as a placeholder (if it exists)

# - logs/* => exclude files in logs, but we'll manually add the logs/ dir itself later
