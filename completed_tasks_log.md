# âœ… Completed Tasks Log

This document tracks completed architectural, tooling, and refactor tasks for the "The Tower" automation project. Once a task is finalized and no longer belongs in the active roadmap, it should be moved here for historical reference.

## ðŸ§± Refactor and Architecture

- Centralized all clickmap access through `get_clickmap()` in `core/clickmap_access.py`
- Removed legacy file `input_named.py` after migrating all usage to `clickmap_access`
- Migrated `clickmap.json` to `config/` and updated all references across tools and tests
- Renamed all clickmap variables to `clickmap` for consistency
- Removed `coords/` folder and redistributed:
  - `gesture_logger.py`, `tune_gesture.py` â†’ `tools/`
  - `clickmap.json` â†’ `config/`
  - `run_tune_gesture` â†’ deleted (manual launch note)
- Refactored tools/crop_region.py and main.py to use get_and_save_screenshot from ss_capture (centralizing save logic)
- Updated tools/crop_region.py to correctly handle gesture logging (single click / swipe, then redraw window).  Also implemented scrolling within the crop window

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

- Verified no external references to `input_named.py`
- Confirmed no remaining hardcoded `coords/` paths after migration

---

## ðŸ“˜ Documentation

- Created `core/input_policy.md` to document dual-path tap architecture
- Updated `README_UPLOAD.md` with summary of input tap architecture and assistant behavior
- Updated `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` to reflect dual-path tap architecture, overlay support, and tap handler split
