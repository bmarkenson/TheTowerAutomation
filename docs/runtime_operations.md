# Runtime Operations

This runbook records stable operational facts for TheTower. Process IDs, waves,
screen states, control directives, and active targets are volatile and must be
re-inspected at the start of every thread.

## Python and repository

- Repository: `/home/brianm/dev/python/TheTower`
- Use `.venv/bin/python`; do not fall back to the system interpreter.
- Run tests as `.venv/bin/python -m pytest`.
- A broken virtual-environment dependency should be repaired rather than
  bypassed with a different interpreter or user-level package installation.

## ADB access

The usual BlueStacks target is `localhost:5555`, but confirm it from the active
lock/process/handoff before acting. Use bounded commands so a disconnected
target cannot stall a development turn:

```bash
timeout 8s adb -s localhost:5555 get-state
timeout 10s adb -s localhost:5555 exec-out screencap -p > /tmp/thetower_current.png
```

The expected connection response is `device`. A command executed inside an
isolated network environment may try to start a second ADB server and fail with
an error such as `could not install *smartsocket* listener: Operation not
permitted`. That result describes the invocation environment; it does **not**
prove that the established host ADB server or emulator target is unavailable.
Retry through the approved host execution path with a timeout and judge the
actual result. Do not build a workaround around a false accessibility
diagnosis.

Project code should use `core.adb_utils` so device selection and shell behavior
remain centralized. The Stats clipboard report is read with Android's clipboard
service; its working lower-level command is:

```bash
adb -s localhost:5555 shell service call clipboard 3 s16 com.android.shell
```

## Mandatory runtime inspection

Inspect these sources together; none is sufficient alone:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/automation_ctl.py status
sed -n '1,160p' logs/automation_ctl.json
sed -n '1,160p' logs/automation-localhost_5555.lock
tail -120 logs/actions.log
timeout 8s adb -s localhost:5555 get-state
```

- The control file is persistent operator intent.
- The lock records the last owner PID and target, but may be stale after a
  crash. Confirm its PID against the host process table before treating it as a
  live owner.
- `actions.log` records what the automation actually observed and dispatched.
- A fresh screenshot is authoritative for the visible UI and can disprove a
  stale wave/status hint.
- Never infer `RUNNING`, `PAUSED`, Game Over, or Home solely from a dated
  handoff.

## Pause, resume, and process replacement

Use the persistent control mechanism:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/automation_ctl.py pause
.venv/bin/python tools/automation_ctl.py pause --minutes 15
.venv/bin/python tools/automation_ctl.py status
.venv/bin/python tools/automation_ctl.py resume
```

After writing `PAUSED`, wait until `actions.log` confirms that the live process
consumed it. Paused automation continues capture, state detection, lifecycle
observation, and status reporting, while strategy and handler actions remain
blocked.

Before replacing a process, verify the current screen and allow any in-progress
guarded action to reach a safe boundary. Stop the known owner cleanly, confirm
its exit, and start the replacement under a persisted pause when validation is
needed before actions resume. Do not kill an arbitrary PID merely because it
appears in a possibly stale lock.

A shell launch returning success is not evidence that a replacement survived
the execution wrapper. Confirm the new host PID, refreshed lock metadata,
startup log, control consumption, and first state report together before
treating the replacement as live.

The Game Over handler polls the same control file while waiting. `PAUSED`
blocks Retry/Home, `STOPPED` exits without a terminal tap, and `WAIT` continues
to wait for an explicit mode change.

## Live-action authority

- Never Surrender a pre-existing or operator-owned battle merely to create a
  development test boundary. A bounded developer-owned battle may be
  Surrendered only after the task author has authorized it and ownership was
  recorded before the battle started.
- Runtime automation may Surrender an active strategy-owned battle only when a
  profile-declared gate has authoritative mismatch evidence for settings that
  cannot be changed during battle. The same guarded workflow must own Game Over
  → Home, correction, restart, and fresh revalidation. Uncertain evidence and
  failures outside that repair class remain blocked without Surrender.
- A profile-declared setting may be repaired in battle only through an explicit
  safe-transition contract. Poison Swamp Stun `on` → `off` requires a freshly
  detected Poison Swamp tile, authoritative detail and checked-control matches,
  verification of `off`, and a verified return to `RUNNING/UW_MENU`. Damage
  Slider enforcement requires `RUNNING/ATTACK_MENU`, authoritative panel/mode/
  OCR evidence before every explicit arrow tap, strict progress, final-value
  verification, and a verified return to `RUNNING/ATTACK_MENU`. Neither path
  authorizes Surrender or Home traversal.
- Safe live validation, verified taps, resumable Exit Battle → Go Home
  traversal, and process restarts are allowed only within the user's stated
  task scope.
- Use fresh source-state evidence immediately before a tap. Transition frames
  and old screenshots do not carry action authority.
- If manual activity or unexpected navigation is visible, pause rather than
  racing the player.
- A natural Game Over is a valuable lifecycle boundary. Preserve it long enough
  to capture evidence or change control state safely; do not manufacture one.
- `--fast-game-over` intentionally suppresses record capture and should be used
  only for a known already-recorded terminal screen. Restart normally afterward
  so future battles remain capture-enabled.

## Evidence and records

- Runtime actions and state: `logs/actions.log`
- Persistent control: `logs/automation_ctl.json`
- Per-battle records: `logs/battles/Battle*.json` and `Battle*.md`
- Failure/OCR evidence: `screenshots/matches/`
- Canonical regression fixtures: `test/fixtures/`
- Actionable backlog: `PENDING_DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Open anomalies: `docs/observed_issues.md`
- Resolved recurrence history: `docs/issues/`

`logs/` and `screenshots/` are ignored runtime evidence, not substitutes for a
tracked issue entry. When an anomaly matters beyond the current thread, record
its date, symptom, evidence, status, and fix/test linkage in the issue ledger.
