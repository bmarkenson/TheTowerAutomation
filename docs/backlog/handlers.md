# Handler Backlog

This file contains active handler orchestration and lifecycle work. Historical
completion evidence remains in the
[`2026-07-16 backlog snapshot`](history/PENDING_DEVELOPMENT_2026-07-16.md).

## Mission rewards

- [ ] Deploy and live-verify open-menu Mission reward scheduling at a safe
  process boundary. The working-tree repair uses section badges when the
  in-battle menu is verified open and retains the attention-dot trigger when it
  is verified closed.

## Dispatch architecture

- [ ] Replace ad-hoc handler calls with a centralized handler registry and
  dispatcher.
  - Define a consistent `should_run()` / `run()` interface or equivalent.
  - Register by primary state, menu, secondary state, or overlay.
  - Preserve ordering and mutual exclusion for handlers that can tap.
  - Integrate per-handler pause/resume with global controls rather than adding a
    second control mechanism.
