# ✅ Completed Tasks Log

This document tracks completed architectural, tooling, and refactor tasks for the "The Tower" automation project. Once a task is finalized and no longer belongs in the active roadmap, it should be moved here for historical reference.

---

## 🧱 Refactor and Architecture

- Centralized all clickmap access through `get_clickmap()` in `core/clickmap_access.py`
- Removed legacy file `input_named.py` after migrating all usage to `clickmap_access`
- Migrated `clickmap.json` to `config/` and updated all references across tools and tests
- Renamed all clickmap variables to `clickmap` for consistency
- Removed `coords/` folder and redistributed:
  - `gesture_logger.py`, `tune_gesture.py` → `tools/`
  - `clickmap.json` → `config/`
  - `run_tune_gesture` → deleted (manual launch note)
- Refactored tools/crop_region.py and main.py to use get_and_save_screenshot from ss_capture (centralizing save logic)
- Updated tools/crop_region.py to correctly handle gesture logging (single click / swipe, then redraw window).  Also implemented scrolling within the crop window

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Verified no external references to `input_named.py`
- Confirmed no remaining hardcoded `coords/` paths after migration

### 2026-07-13 live automation validation

- Added and live-verified `--adb-port` support with default port 5555.
- Made GC the default strategy and added an exclusive new-run startup gate.
- Live-verified the startup order: EHLS first, EALS second, then the
  session-scoped Target Priority check; both skip boxes were visibly `Max`.
- Split Exit Battle into guarded `Surrender` and `Go Home` actions; live-tested
  that Go Home preserves and resumes the same run and Surrender reaches Game
  Stats.
- Repaired Round Stats scrolling with source-screen guards and true-edge
  detection; live-tested the complete Game Over capture flow.
- Split home/in-run Store navigation, retained red-badge availability as the
  trigger, added a home red-badge region, and live-tested inactive Daily Gems as
  a normal not-ready result.
- Replaced generic per-tick EHLS/EALS searches with a dedicated exclusive,
  state-driven initializer. It uses fast label templates and upgrade geometry,
  detects the rectangular gold `Max` border directly, supports either or both
  upgrades beginning gold boxed, and defers wave OCR until purchasing is done.
  Purchase taps continue independently of capture latency; a continuously
  drained H.264 stream supplies current verification frames, with guarded raw
  capture as fallback. In the final fresh live regression, EHLS gold boxed at
  wave 20 and EALS at wave 30 in both final fresh regressions. Human `touch`
  markers recorded the first EALS dispatch 0.285 and 0.472 seconds after EHLS
  became visibly gold (tap completion at 0.742 and 0.748 seconds). Completion
  waves, EALS first-tap wave/time, total elapsed time, tap count, and failure
  reason are recorded.

## 📘 Documentation

- Created `core/input_policy.md` to document dual-path tap architecture
- Updated `README_UPLOAD.md` with summary of input tap architecture and assistant behavior
- Updated `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` to reflect dual-path tap architecture, overlay support, and tap handler split
